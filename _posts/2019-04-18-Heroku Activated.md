Noice!

Well done. I have now completed:
* install jekyll and dependancies (rbenv etc)
* generate a new jekyll blog 
* initialize a git repo
* create a new heroku app from heroku-cli
* learn what a "dyno" is in heroku and how to activate it
* success!

In writing this post I serendipitously discovered that setting the datetime for the future in a jekyll `_post` will hide it from the index, so that's cool.
