I've made some quick progress on restarting a blog. It's fun. I remember the rich history of publishing content on the intenet, the birth of the web, and the connections between us that this cyber-space is built of.

Sometimes, I seem to wax philosophic, or pretensious perhaps. I find it is a skill useful to the art and science of software. At times. Other times it can be such a habitual distraction from concrete tasks. 

In building this blog I've gotten in touch with some core feelings about the role the internet play, specifically the world wid web, on the transformations of the world over the last two decades. What is the _thing_ then? 

It is not the internet itself, it is the way technology allows the expediation of the human enterprise, the navigation of the world through cognitive activity. It's not _cyber_ space becuase it's a fun name, it's the space in which our mental models interface. The nature of the internet itself is social. There is no "social web", because the web itself is founded on the principle of linking knowledge, but knowledge is a human social entity. Knowledge is something crafted on top of experience. It doesn't replace it, and it doesn't negate it, they co-exist.

A fun component of this is that, much like journals, there needs be no T-V distinction. One's audience can be a time-offset self, both same and other. But habits should take a break, sometimes.
