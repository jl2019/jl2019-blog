## What happened??
I went to continue work today on [`zoe-feedlog`](https://zoe-feedlog.herokuapp.com) and I got a new snag.

Rails seemed to be running my app fine, but failed on calling the database.

Ok... huh.

First I tried:

`$ postgres`
```
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.63.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/postgres
  Reason: image not found
Abort trap: 6
```

Looks like postgres can't find an `icu4c` library.

What's in the location where `postgres` is referencing?
```
$ ls -l /usr/local/opt/icu4c
lrwxr-xr-x  1 j19  admin  20 Apr 24 11:32 /usr/local/opt/icu4c -> ../Cellar/icu4c/64.2

# and if we follow the symlink?
$ ls -Hl /usr/local/opt/icu4c

```
Interesting. So `postgres` is looking for 63.1, and `homebrew` has updated to 64.2.

<section markdown="1">
## Did I do that?
It's possible the problem came from something installed with homebrew, so let's look through the history find out what I've recently installed.  

`$ brew ls --help`
```
Usage: brew list, ls [options]
List all installed formulae.
    -l    List in long format. If the output is to a
          terminal, a total sum for all the file
          sizes is output on a line before the long
          listing.
    -t    Sort by time modified (most recently
          modified first).
```

`$ brew ls -lt | head -n 3`
```
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 j19  staff  102 Apr 26 04:57 terminal-notifier
drwxr-xr-x  3 j19  staff  102 Apr 24 11:33 php
```
Looks like it might be related to `php` since the modification date is Apr 24 for both the `php` package, and the `INSTALL_RECEIPT.json`.

A look in the `INSTALL_RECEIPT.json` shows `"tap":"homebrew/core"`.

[link 4](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/304345/show-installation-date-of-packages-installed-with-homebrew "stackexchange show homebrew installed packages by date") says: 
<blockquote markdown="1">
`brew ls -lt` lists installed packages, sorted by last modified date of the package installation directory, newest to oldest.
Equivalent results can be obtained with:
```
find /usr/local/Cellar -type d -maxdepth 0 | xargs ls -lt
```
With this incantation, sort order can be changed by adding `-U` (creation date) or `-u` (last access date) to the `ls -lt`
```
$ find /usr/local/Cellar -type d -maxdepth 0 | xargs ls -ltU # creation aka *installation date*
$ find /usr/local/Cellar -type d -maxdepth 0 | xargs ls -ltu # last access aka last use date
```
Add `-r` to `ls -lt` to reverse order, oldest to newest.

`brew ls -l` lists installed packages in alphabetical order.

It's unknown to me whether Homebrew affects a package folder's creation date during brew upgrade, so be aware that learning the first installation date of a package may be elusive.

The `-a` option for `brew ls -l` appears to be no longer available

## Not quite there.
I started with `brew switch icu4c 63.1`.
This should quickly put things back to where they were before.

==> Caveats
icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).

If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"

For pkg-config to find icu4c you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"

==> Analytics
install: 331,477 (30 days), 872,329 (90 days), 3,037,546 (365 days)
install_on_request: 14,572 (30 days), 34,237 (90 days), 124,728 (365 days)
build_error: 0 (30 days)

```

Now when I run `brew services restart postgres`[ * ](#oops "This wasn't the same way I was testing if postgres was working, so...") I get:

```
$ brew services restart postgresql
==> Successfully started `postgresql` (label: homebrew.mxcl.postgresql)
```

When I ran `brew info postgres` and got this out:
```
$ brew info postgres

  postgres-xc (because postgresql and postgres-xc install the same binaries.)

  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

I notice on the required line that `icu4c` has a checkmark `✔`, but why does `readline` have a `✘`? `postgres` appears to be working now, but possibly `readline` is required for `psql` functionality?

## Conclusion:

I wonder also if the problem was just in the linking, if I switch back to 64.2 homebrew will create the correct links?

I think I see. When I ran `brew switch icu4c 64.2` it auto started from `brew services`.

But `postgres` and `pg_ctl` are still looking for 63.1. 

Well... ok, let's go back.

Ok, switching to 63.1 allows `postgres` to connect, because it's looking for 63.1. What if instead of switching to an older `icu4c` what if I upgrade `postgresql`? Will that also upgrade `readline` and then link the the current `icu4c`?

Let's try.
