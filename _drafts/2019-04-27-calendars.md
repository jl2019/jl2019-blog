I like calendars. Here is my 5 * 73 day season calendar.

72/4
13/

365-5 # => "holidays" between each season
360/2
180/2
 72/2
 36/2
 18/2
  9

   9 days = 1 week
+ 18 days = 2 weeks = ?
+ 36 days = 4 weeks = 1 month
+ 72 days = 8 weeks = 2 months 
+ +1 day  = holiday
 73 days = 1 season
146 days = 2 seasons
219 days = 3 seasons
292 days = 4 seasons
365 days = 5 seasons = 1 year
```
