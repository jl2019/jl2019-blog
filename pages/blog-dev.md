Setting up features for this blog.
- [x] `_drafts`  
Set up a drafts folder for works in progress. This post used to live there until I set these things up!
- [x] `pages`  
Set up a directory to collect pages in. This just keeps the project root cleaner. Permalinks can still be configured from front matter.
- [x] `config.yml`  
Add a bit of customization&#8253;
- [x] `_sass`  
Customize some styles and tidy up this blog
- [ ] `_layouts`  
I haven't added any overrides here yet. To figure out what to replace I can look in the theme's gem source. [here]
- [ ] [`disqus`](https://disqus.com/admin/install/platforms/jekyll/)  
I'm strongly considering adding disqus comments. Comments are one silk thread that weaves this social web.
